# cupcakecatcher
A cupcake catcher game I created by following step by step from a javascript course I was doing

Instructions:
Press arrow keys (← → ↑) to move left, right and jump respectively
Eat the cupcakes to increase score
When cupcakes hit bridge, tiles collapse
Game over when you fall down.
Click on the canvas below to start/restart the game
