# cupcakecatcher
A cupcake catcher game I created by following step by step from a javascript course I was doing

You can download my project and run the index.html file in a browser to play the game.

Instructions:
Press arrow keys (← → ↑) to move left, right and jump respectively
Eat the cupcakes to increase score
When cupcakes hit bridge, tiles collapse
Game over when you fall down.
